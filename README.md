 - 👋 As a researcher and first-year postgraduate student(2023-2024).
 - 📚 Set to graduate in July 2025 and now actively seek opportunities for advancement.
 - 🌱 I have a multi-disciplinary background in Computer Science from my undergraduate studies (with extensive experience in software development, blockchain, front-end design and distributed systems) and Intelligent Robotics in my master's program, where I am delving deeper into computer vision algorithms and have gained significant expertise in developing vision-based target detection and tracking algorithms, hardware design, control systems, and mechanical design for biomimetic robots.
 - 🔍 Always on the path of self-learning, seeking great mentors (a.k.a. 'big daddies')!
